Theme 7: Music Theory for Kids (KidZik) 
"Music Theory for Kids" is a web application designed to teach young children the basics of 
music theory interactively and playfully. The application focuses on learning music notes, 
simple rhythms, and basic concepts of music theory. It is entirely front-end, meaning it can be 
used without an internet connection, and uses localStorage or IndexedDB to store data locally 
on the user's browser. 
Features: 
 Attractive user interface: Design a colorful and user-friendly interface, with illustrations 
and animations suitable for children. 
 Learning notes: Create interactive lessons to teach children the names and positions of 
music notes on a staff. 
 Ear training exercises: Integrate games where children can listen to sequences of notes 
and correctly identify them. 
 Memory games: Provide memory games where children must match music notes to their 
corresponding names. 
 Simple rhythms: Include exercises to teach children basic rhythms, such as note values 
(whole, half, quarter, etc.) and rests. 
 Interactive quizzes: Create interactive quizzes to assess children's knowledge of basic 
music theory concepts. 
 Progress tracking: Allow children to track their progress through lessons and games, 
with visual indicators and summaries. 
 Customization mode: Offer children the ability to customize their experience by 
choosing avatars or themes. 
Prerequisites: 
 HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the structure, style, and interaction of the application. 
 Use of Bootstrap for the grid system and responsive user interface components. 
 Use of localStorage or IndexedDB for local storage of user data. 
 Optionally, the use of JavaScript libraries for animations and advanced interactions, but 
without the use of major frameworks.
